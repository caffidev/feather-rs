# Contributing to Feather

Feather is an ambitious project, and contributions are always welcome!

If you want to work on the codebase, please keep the following in mind:
* Run `rustfmt` on your code before committing. The CI build will fail if rustfmt detects formatting errors.
* Run [`clippy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) on your code and fix any warnings it gives. Clippy can detect common mistakes, and as with formatting, the build will fail if there are Clippy warnings.
* Where possible and necessary, please write tests.
* Run `cargo test` before committing to ensure you have not broken anything (you could change something, and buh you broke vanilla code whatsoever)

## Notes to your code
For notes to your code check the Checklist from [`pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Semantic versioning
When bumping version, you MUST follow this: https://semver.org/

## Commits
When committing you MUST follow this (not strictly, but MUST):
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ru/v1.0.0-beta.2/

## Comments
You don't need to do ambigious comments, kiss.
They SHOULD start from capital letters, although some arguments are exception.
They SHOULD also be on other line, where code is missing.

## Naming Quantities
Variables intended to hold quantities should be written with the `_count`/`_amount` suffix instead of the `num_` prefix. It is for differianting numeric types and amounts.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Countable nouns</th>
<th>Uncountable nouns</th>
<th>Not acceptable</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```rust
let block_count = ...;
```
</td>
<td>

```rust
let block_amount = ...;
```
</td>
<td>

```rust
let num_blocks = ...;
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

# Original code (code from Minecraft)

> ðŸ›‘ **Do not use any of code based of Minecraft's source**: Please do not write code that is in any way inspired, based on, or taken from Mojang's work, including but not limited to
the vanilla server and client. Feather is a "clean-room" implementation, meaning that it is written
from scratch without any involvement with proprietary code. By using code from Mojang, the project
would become prone to legal issues.

# Contributing to Feather

Feather is an ambitious project, and contributions are always welcome!

If you want to work on the codebase, please keep the following in mind:
* Run `rustfmt` on your code before committing. The CI build will fail if rustfmt detects formatting errors.
* Run [`clippy`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) on your code and fix any warnings it gives. Clippy can detect common mistakes, and as with formatting, the build will fail if there are Clippy warnings.
* Where possible and necessary, please write tests.
* Run `cargo test` before committing to ensure you have not broken anything (you could change something, and buh you broke vanilla code whatsoever)

## Proper base
When opening a PR, please make sure your branch targets the latest release branch, in this case it would be main. Also make sure your branch is even with the target branch, to avoid unnecessary surprises.

## Proper titles
When opening issues, make sure the title reflects the purpose of the issue or the pull request. Prefer past tense, and be brief. Further description belongs inside the issue or PR.

## Descriptive changes

We require the commits describe the change made. It can be a short description. If you fixed or resolved an open issue, please reference it by using the # notation.

Examples of good commit messages:

    Fixed a potential memory leak with cache entities. Fixes #142.
    Implemented new command extension. Resolves #169.
    Changed message cache behaviour. It's now global instead of per-channel.
    Fixed a potential NRE.

    Changed message cache behaviour:

    - Cache itself is now a ring buffer.

## Code style
You should follow all rust and clippy recommendations, but not necessary.

## Notes to your code
For notes to your code check the Checklist from [`pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md)

## Semantic versioning
When bumping version, you MUST follow this: https://semver.org/

## Commits
When committing you MUST follow this (not strictly, but MUST):
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ru/v1.0.0-beta.2/

## Comments
You don't need to do ambigious comments, kiss.
They SHOULD start from capital letters, although some arguments are exception.
They SHOULD also be on other line, where code is missing.

## Naming Quantities
Variables intended to hold quantities should be written with the `_count`/`_amount` suffix instead of the `num_` prefix. It is for differianting numeric types and amounts.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Countable nouns</th>
<th>Uncountable nouns</th>
<th>Not acceptable</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```rust
let block_count = ...;
```
</td>
<td>

```rust
let block_amount = ...;
```
</td>
<td>

```rust
let num_blocks = ...;
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

# Original code (code from Minecraft)

the vanilla server and client. Feather is a "clean-room" implementation, meaning that it is written
